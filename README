	* PlayBoiler

This is a very simple module for the Play! Framework. It aims to
give developers an easy way to integrate the HTML5Boilerplate
project in to a new installation of the Play! Framework.

The module comes with the HTML5Boilerplate files set up in a
suitable structure for Play. The module copies these
files in to the Play! project when given the command.

Instructions:

1. Copy the playboiler folder in to your modules folder
2. Add the following line to the dependencies.yml
    - play -> playboiler 0.1.0
3. Run "play deps" to update the dependencies

Commands:
$ play playboiler:help		- Display a short help text
$ play playboiler:init		- Copy the boilerplate files in 
				  to the project folder

Note: The module overwrites any conflicting files, so it is
strongly recommended that you only run the init command on a 
fresh installation of Play!.
